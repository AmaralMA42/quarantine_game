## An epidemiological model with voluntary quarantine strategies governed by evolutionary game dynamics


----------
Supplemental material containing the numerical integration of the quarantine game model of SIR infection dynamics.
----------
This material is a simplified version with the goal of helping interested readers and students to further develop their own models and variations of an epidemiological dynamic with game theory mechanisms.
The current script is a simplified version of the complete model for the interested reader.
All parameters are defined at the beggining of the script and can be freely changed inside the realistic range of each one.
For simplicity this script uses the scipy ODE solver method.
